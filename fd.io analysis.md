**Current Usage**

Current usage of fd.ioFD.io (Fast Data - Input/Output) is an open-source project that provides a modular, extensible, and high-performance IO services framework for the next generation of network and storage software. FD.io offers a set of libraries, drivers, and other components that can be used to build highly optimized network function virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN), and container networking solutions. Cutoff in September 2021, FD.io was being used in a variety of production environments, including cloud service provider networks, telecommunications networks, and enterprise data centers. Some of the companies that were using FD.io or contributing to the project at that time included Cisco, Intel, Red Hat, Huawei, and AT&T.Since then, there may have been updates to the project and its usage. It's worth noting that open-source projects like FD.io are constantly evolving, and their usage can change rapidly depending on the needs and priorities of the developer community.

**Technical Details**

Architecture: FD.io is designed with a microservices architecture, which allows developers to create and deploy lightweight, independent software components that can be easily integrated into the platform. The platform consists of two main components: VPP (Vector Packet Processing) and Honeycomb

VPP: VPP is a high-performance, software-based packet processing engine that provides fast packet I/O and advanced network services, such as routing, switching, and security. It supports a variety of network protocols, including IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and Ethernet.

Honeycomb: Honeycomb is a modular, programmable, and extensible interface for managing VPP instances. It provides a REST API and a web-based UI that allow operators to configure, monitor, and control the VPP instances.

Plugins: FD.io supports a wide range of plugins that provide additional functionality, such as traffic classification, load balancing, and network monitoring. These plugins can be easily integrated into the platform using a plugin API

Compatibility: FD.io is compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. It also supports a range of hardware platforms, including x86, ARM, and PowerPC.

Development: FD.io is developed in C, C++, and Python. The codebase is hosted on GitHub, and developers can contribute to the project using the standard GitHub workflow.Overall, FD.io provides a high-performance and flexible data plane platform that can be easily customized and extended to meet the specific needs of different applications and use cases in the networking industry.

**Other Information**

These are few projects that similar to fd.io:-

DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit): DPDK is an open-source software development kit that provides a set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing in networking applications. Like fd.io, DPDK provides high-performance networking functionality, but it is more focused on packet processing and is primarily used in the telecommunications industry.

Open vSwitch: Open vSwitch is a multilayer virtual switch that enables network automation, visibility, and management in virtualized environments. Like fd.io, Open vSwitch is open-source software that provides high-performance networking functionality, but it is more focused on virtualized environments.

Netmap: Netmap is a high-speed packet I/O framework that provides a unified API for accessing network interfaces in user space. It is similar to fd.io in that it provides high-performance packet processing capabilities, but it is more focused on I/O operations and is primarily used in network monitoring and security applications.
