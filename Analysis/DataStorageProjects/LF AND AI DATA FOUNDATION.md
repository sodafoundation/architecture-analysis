**LF AND AI DATA FOUNDATION**

**INTRODUCTION**

What is LF AI & Data?

LF AI & Data is **an umbrella foundation of the Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and data**.

**LF**

**LF Energy** **is a Linux Foundation Project that Supports multi-vender collaboration and open source innovation in the energy.**

The **Linux Foundation** (**LF**) is a [non-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization") technology consortium founded in 2000 as a merger between [Open Source Development Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Development_Labs "Open Source Development Labs") and the [Free Standards Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Standards_Group "Free Standards Group") to standardize [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"), support its growth, and promote its commercial adoption. Additionally, it hosts and promotes the collaborative development of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") software projects. It is a major force in promoting diversity and inclusion in both Linux and the wider open source software community.

The foundation was launched in 2000, under the [Open Source Development Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Development_Labs "Open Source Development Labs") (OSDL) and became the organization it is today when OSDL merged with the [Free Standards Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Standards_Group "Free Standards Group") (FSG). The Linux Foundation sponsors the work of Linux creator [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds") and lead maintainer [Greg Kroah-Hartman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman "Greg Kroah-Hartman"). Furthermore, it is supported by members, such as [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T "AT&T"), [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco "Cisco"), [Fujitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu "Fujitsu"), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), [Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi "Hitachi"), [Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei "Huawei"), [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM"), [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel"), [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms "Meta Platforms"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation#cite_note-6)  [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation#cite_note-7)  [NEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC "NEC"), [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation "Oracle Corporation"), [Orange S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A. "Orange S.A."), [Qualcomm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm "Qualcomm"), [Samsung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung "Samsung"), [Tencent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent "Tencent"), and [VMware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware "VMware"), as well as developers from around the world.

In recent years, the Linux Foundation has expanded its support programs through events, training and certification, as well as open source projects. Projects hosted at the Linux Foundation include the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") project, [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes "Kubernetes"), [Automotive Grade Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Grade_Linux "Automotive Grade Linux"), [ONAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONAP "ONAP") (Open Network Automation Platform), [Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger "Hyperledger"), [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Native_Computing_Foundation "Cloud Native Computing Foundation"), [Cloud Foundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Foundry "Cloud Foundry") Foundation, [Xen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen "Xen") project, and many others.

**AI**

Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics,  and Engineering. A major thrust of AI is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem solving.

Over the course of the last decade, the landscape of AI and data technologies has begun to rely heavily on the open source community. We have seen a shift both in enterprise adoption of open source software as well as an increased reliance on open source software in the base of proprietary software solutions that provide value-added capabilities on top of the open source distribution. These value-added capabilities can range from the creation and management of ‘enterprise grade’ distributions that began, in the early 20-teens, with Python, R, and Hadoop leading the charge. The primary governing foundations for these distributions are the Apache Foundation and the Linux Foundation as these governing bodies provide a governance and license structure that is more conducive to enterprise adoption. The Linux Foundation and its AI and Data umbrella foundation (LF AI & Data) are critical to our (IBM’s) strategy as we rely heavily on the consumption of LF AI & Data projects, the contribution to LF AI & Data projects, and the founding of new AI and data projects and committees hosted in LF AI & Data. This is exemplified in our standing as one of the leading contributors to LF AI & Data and a leading contributor to the Linux Foundation. As one of the major AI and data vendors, we see a responsibility to make certain technologies available freely to the world in AI as it relates to the robustness of AI, the fairness of AI, and the explainability of AI.
