## Introduction

Open filer is an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) that provides file-based [network-attached storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) and block-based [storage area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network). It was created by Xinit Systems, and is based on the [CentOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS)  [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution). It is [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) licensed under the [GNU GPLv2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GPLv2).

The Openfiler codebase was started at Xinit Systems in 2001. The company created a project and donated the codebase to it in October 2003.The first public release of Openfiler was made in May 2004. The latest release was published in 2011.

## Project details

## Key features:

Open filer key features such as iSCSI target for virtualization, Fibre Channel target support, block level replication and High Availabilty that are the mainstay of any business critical storage environment.

  

## Architecture:

## Current usage:
Open filer includes support for volume-based partitioning, iSCSI [](https://www.openfiler.com/learn/glossary/iscsi) (target and initiator), scheduled snapshots, resource quota, and a single unified interface for share management which makes allocating shares for various network file-system protocols a breeze.

## Technical details:

Technical features in a storage solution can compensate for a lack of good administrative capabilities. Openfiler meets this challenge head-on with its powerful and intuitive web-based graphical user interface (GUI). All facets of the trove of storage networking capabilities in Openfiler are controlled via this management interface. Management capabilities are grouped into separate sub-interfaces in accordance with their functional domain; networking, physical volumes, user and group authentication/authorization, system configuration and status information are each given a scope.

## Other information:
