Dell EMC's architecture is designed to provide a flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure for data storage and management. Some key elements of Dell EMC's architecture include:

- Scale-out architecture: Dell EMC's storage solutions are built on a scale-out architecture, which allows organizations to easily add capacity and performance as needed. This allows organizations to start small and grow their storage infrastructure as their data needs increase.

- Software-defined storage: Dell EMC's storage solutions are built on a software-defined storage (SDS) architecture, which allows organizations to easily manage and automate their storage infrastructure. SDS abstracts the underlying hardware from the storage software, making it easier to provision, manage, and scale storage resources.

- Data protection and recovery: Dell EMC's data protection and recovery solutions are built on a multi-tiered architecture that includes local and remote backups, disaster recovery, and archiving. This allows organizations to protect their data at multiple levels and recover it quickly in the event of a failure or disaster.

- Cloud and multi-cloud support: Dell EMC's cloud and multi-cloud solutions are built on a hybrid architecture that allows organizations to easily move their data and workloads between on-premises and cloud-based environments. This allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of the cloud while still maintaining control over their data and infrastructure.

- Edge computing: Dell EMC's edge computing solutions are designed to process data at the edge of network, by using the devices which are closer to the data source, reducing the latency and the data travel time.

Dell EMC is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies that provides a range of data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services.
