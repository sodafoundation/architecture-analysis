**Architecture**

  

Ceph is a distributed storage system based on the object storage model. It is composed of three main components: the monitor, the object storage device (OSD), and the metadata server (MDS).

  

The Monitor (MON) is responsible for maintaining the cluster’s configuration, health, and status. It is also responsible for managing the cluster’s membership and distributing the cluster’s configuration to the other components.

  

The Object Storage Device (OSD) is responsible for storing data objects. Each OSD runs on a single physical or virtual machine and is responsible for managing the data stored on its device.

  

The Metadata Server (MDS) is responsible for managing the metadata associated with each object stored in the cluster. It is also responsible for managing the namespace and creating, deleting, and updating directories and files.
