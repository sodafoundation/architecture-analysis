|--|--|
| **Organization**  | **Robin systems** |
|  **License**|  **Not Open source**|
|**Open/proprietary**  | **Proprietary** |
|**Source Path**   | **Nil**  |
| **Brief Description**  |**Robin designs and develops application software , it provides hyper-converged kubernetes platform for information technology and business initiatives for big data and databases.** |



## **_PROJECT DETAILS:_**

**Key features:**

● **Automate all aspects of critical day-2 operations to run databases, big data, time series and message queue services in production on Kubernetes.**

● **_Highest performing storage and data management for any Kubernetes on-premises or in any cloud._**


● **_Run Containers and VM on kubernetes and manage their lifecycle using one  common interface._**

● **Application Deployment and lifecycle management.**

● **Consistent storage experience across different environments. Allow easy migration and portability of apps along with their data across different cloud environments.**


## **Architecture :**

**_It is a fully cloud-native and microservices-based architecture that is multi-access, multi - platform, and multi-cloud._**

## **_Application workflow manager:_**

**_The management and tracking of tasks performed or temporarily halted due to an issue are simplified .It automatically records information for each activity and provides tools to report information about each task._**



## App - aware storage :

**_Application awareness is a term for systems that have built in information or “awareness” about individual applications,in order to better interact with these applications._**



## *_Kubernetes:_*

**_It automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications,rolling out changes to your applications up and down to fit changing needs , monitoring your applications, which makes it easier to manage applications._**



## **_Robin Products:-_**
