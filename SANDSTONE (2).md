_**CURRENT USAGE:_**

_Currently, enterprise applications obviously end to be mobile and intelligent and the types of the data generated by applications are changing, with pictures, videos, voice, documents and other unstructured data absolutely dominant in the total enterprise data. Moreover, traditional storage has become a bottle neck in the digital transformation of enterprises and it is a must to choose more appropriate storage technology for IT infrastructure construction._ _At present, more than_ _80%_ _of new data are unstructured data; More than_ _95%_ _data is unstructured data in the future._

 - _ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT_
 - AI APPLICATIONS_
 - _IMAGE/VIDEO STORAGE_
 - BROAD CASTING MEDIA
 - BIG DATA STORAGE AND ANALYSIS
 - BACKUP/ARCHIVING

## _TECHNICALDETAILS_

_In order to respond quickly to the requirements of the rapidly changing infrastructure and realize the high scalability and flexibility of IT system,  virtualization, private cloud and container technology are widely used in IT infrastructure, and the enterprise data center architecture is becoming increasingly complex, so the traditional SAN+NAS storage scheme cannot meet the complex application requirements any more

_Sand Stone USP as a brand-new software-defined storage system can provide block and file storage services, support various database workloads, virtualization applications and cloud native applications at the same time, and meet the requirements of key businesses and various applications for storage. So far, bimodal IT has become the new normal of enterprise IT ;the elastic software-defined architecture enables_

_Sand Stone USP not only support a wide range of multi –virtualized scenarios ,but also integrated well with the ecosystem of main stream container platforms ,so it can provide applications with high-performance snapshot ,cross-data – center disaster recovery and other enterprise-level storage services .More over,its software system can be deployed in a general server, able to constantly update the hardware so that the system could always be kept in the best state and could quickly respond to the requirements of complex and dynamic business in the future._
