<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
*Nutanix Objects™ (Objects) is a software-defined Object Store Service. This<br>
service is designed with an Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service<br>
(AWS S3) compatible REST API interface capable of handling petabytes of<br>
unstructured and machine-generated data. Objects addresses storage-related<br>
use cases for backup, and long-term retention and data storage for your<br>
cloud-native applications by using standard S3 APIs. You no longer have to<br>
introduce an external, separately managed storage solution.</p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br>
Ensure compliance and data protection<br>
Enable Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) policies on any object to ensure data fidelity<br>
and immutability for data retention and compliance. Protect everything with integrated<br>
encryption to a level of FIPS 140-2 compliance.<br>
Support any workload from a single platform<br>
Get S3-compatible storage for big data, cloud-native and deep archive workloads. It’s a<br>
single, flexible platform that stores file, block, VM, and many other types of workloads.<br>
Enhance data visibility with tagging and versioning<br>
Quickly identify objects by tagging them. Tag objects based on projects, compliance<br>
and more. Create copies of objects and protect your data from accidentally overwriting<br>
or deleting it.</p>
