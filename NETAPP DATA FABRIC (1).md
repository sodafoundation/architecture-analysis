The architecture of NetApp Data Fabric is designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for organizations to move and manage their data across different environments and platforms.

The architecture consists of several components, including:
 - **NetApp ONTAP**: The foundation of the Data Fabric, ONTAP is a proprietary software that provides the data storage, data protection, and data management capabilities for the Data Fabric.
- **Data Fabric Manager (DFM)**: A centralized management console that provides a single point of control for the Data Fabric, enabling organizations to easily discover, understand, and manage their data across different environments.
- **Cloud Volumes ONTAP (CVO)**: A software-defined storage solution that enables organizations to run ONTAP in the cloud, providing the ability to easily move and manage data between on-premises and cloud environments.
- **Cloud Data Services**: A set of services that provide data protection, data governance, and data analytics capabilities for the Data Fabric.
- **Cloud Backup Services**: A set of services that provide data protection and disaster recovery capabilities for the Data Fabric, including backup and replication of data to the cloud.
- **Cloud Control Plane**: A set of services that provide the ability to manage and monitor the Data Fabric across different environments and platforms, including on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud.
- **Cloud Connectors**: A set of connectors that allow the Data Fabric to integrate with other data management solutions, including those based on open source software.

The Data Fabric architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing organizations to easily add or remove components as needed to meet their specific data management needs.

**Usage**
NetApp Data Fabric is used by organizations across a wide range of industries to manage and protect their data across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. The data fabric powered by NetApp simplifies and integrates data management across cloud and on-premises environments to accelerate digital transformation.The data fabric powered by NetApp delivers consistent and integrated data management services and applications (building blocks) for data visibility and insights, data access and control, and data protection and security, as shown in the figure below.

The data fabric powered by NetApp provides the following nine proven use cases for customers:
 - Accelerate analytics workloads
 - Accelerate DevOps transformation
 - Build cloud hosting infrastructure
 - Integrate cloud data services
 - Protect and secure data
 - Optimize unstructured data
 - Gain data center efficiencies
 - Deliver data insights and control
 - Simplify and automate
 
 **NetApp NFS direct access**
![Data fabric powered by NetApp for big data architecture](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/netapp-solutions/media/hdcs-sh-image2.png)
 The NetApp NFS direct access (formerly known as NetApp In-Place Analytics Module) (shown in the figure below) allows customers to run big data analytics jobs on their existing or new NFSv3 or NFSv4 data without moving or copying the data. It prevents multiple copies of data and eliminates the need to sync the data with a source. For example, in the financial sector, the movement of data from one place to another place must meet legal obligations, which is not an easy task. In this scenario, the NetApp NFS direct access analyzes the financial data from its original location. Another key benefit is that using the NetApp NFS direct access simplifies protecting Hadoop data by using native Hadoop commands and enables data protection workflows leveraging NetApp’s rich data management portfolio.

**Building blocks for big data**
