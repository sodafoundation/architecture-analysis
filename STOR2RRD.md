**CURRENT USAGE:**

 - IBM Storwize V7000, V5000, V3700
 - IBM SVC
 - IBM FlashSystem V9000
 - IBM System Storage DS8000 and DS6800
 -  LSI / Engenio based storages
 

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

The tool is able to provide base for your storage accounting based on
allocated data in the time.
Capacity allocation data is stored per:

 - Pool
 - Tier
 - Volume

Capacity data is stored every hour.

Customers with premiumsupport subscription can use a framework
which exports capacity allocation data from the tool in the format
required by each customer.

Output format options:

 - CSV
 -  XLS
 - JSON
 -  XML
 - PDF
 - Graphical in the UI


Further reporting options:

 

 - Raw capacity allocation (include RAID and spare disk

overhead)

 -  Automated creation and either saving in defined location or

sending via email

 - One or more defined storage in single report
 - Daily/weekly/monthly or custom date based reports
 - REST API

Examples

 - EXCEL REPORTS

PROJECT COMPARISION

 -  LPAR2RRD

**LPAR2RRD** is an open-source software tool that is used for
monitoring and reporting performance of servers, clouds and
databases. It is developed by the Czech company XoruX.

LPAR2RRD is open source software that is published under the GNU
license . As of April 2022, the latest version is 7.40. The software was
first launched in 2006.
The software tool is designed to monitor and report on server
visualization utilizations. It produces utilization graphs, reports, or alerts
of physical or virtual servers on CPU, memory, IOPS, and many other
depending on specific virtualization platform. It also supports database
engines as oracle database, postgresql or containerization platforms
like openshift or docker. Cloud technologies are supported as well.

**OTHER INFORMATION:**

STOR2RRD is a performance monitoring and capacity planning tool for storage
and SAN, which monitors all your storage devices within one centralized
console. All required information regarding your disk arrays, ports, pools,
ranks, mdisks, volumes and drives are presented in a simple understandable
form on your STOR2RRD console. You can easily find out actual and historical
performance data (to track issues and bottlenecks) and quickly respond to any
performance problem. It is able to aggregate performance information for
group of volumes across your environment (regardless of storage unit).

THE latest versions of stor2rrd:

 -  IBM FlashSystem V9000 support
 - Alerting based on performance thresholds

**FUTURE PLANS ENHANCEMENT:**

 -  support for EMC, Hitachi, HP and NetApp storages

 -  LPAR2RRD and STOR2RRD integra
